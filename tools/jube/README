main MDFT perf eval JUBE script : mdft_PerfEval.xml
Possible tags : 
ref : reference run
scalasca : score-p trace collection run, scalasca analysis
papi : score-p profiling with papi metrics (look in the script for more details)
darshan : de-activated for the moment. reason : parsing bugs
no-vec : de-activated SIMD
no-fma : de-activated FMA
scatter : scatters openmp threads on 2 sockets
gather : gathers openmp threads on one socket
memory : performs memory profiling

all : performs all compile/run modes above!

COPY_FILES : to copy and compile the local source files. The default behaviour, without this flag, is to git clone the files from the github repo. 
NO_OMP : deactivates OpenMP, runs on 1 thread instead of 12.

Known issues : 
1 - bug on OpenMP level. For the moment, the PerfEval runs only with NO_OMP tag.
2 - darshan mode failing because of post processing errors (new darshan version = new keywords to parse). It has been deactivated from the tag "all"
3 - no-fma mode dull with GFORTRAN :  the compilation flag -mno-fmaf deactivated because it fails the compilation.  
4 - scatter and gather modes dull with NO_OMP, as not possible with only 1 thread.
Warning : 
indentation of some parameters is important. do not auto-indent.
