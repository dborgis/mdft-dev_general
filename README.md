# MDFT

## What for

MDFT is classical, molecular density functional theory code. It is aimed at computing density profiles of solvent around a solute
and the free energy of solvation.

## Authors

MDFT is developped in the group of Daniel Borgis at the Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France, by
	- Daniel Borgis
	- Maximilien Levesque
	- Guillaume Jeanmairet
        - Volodymyr Sergiievskyi

## Installation

For now, a simple `make` will do all the necessary stuff.

## Input File

Three files are necessary.
-   `dft.in` contains simulation informations
-   `solute.in` contains informations about the solute (force field, position, etc)
-   `solvent.in` contains all information about the solvent (force field, position, etc)

### dft.in

#### Preliminary information

`dft.in` is read by the program in any order. Lines may be thus be interchanged.
Only usefull tags will be omitted, but no default choice is made for the user.

`MDFT` is looking for tags. For instance, the whole `dft.in` is parsed in order to find `nfft1`. The value of which is then read
and feeds the code.

Comments should be declared by symbol `#`. Everything that follows this symbol is not considered by `MDFT`.
For instance, in `nfft1 = 32 # 64 in the previous calculation`, only `nfft1 = 32` is considered by `MDFT`.

The rule is `tag = info`. There should be a space before and another after the equal sign.

Empty and blank lines are not considered.

#####SUPERCELL

* `Lx` Length of the orthorombic supercell in x direction
* `Ly` Length of the orthorombic supercell in y direction
* `Lz` Length of the orthorombic supercell in z direction
* `nfft1` Number of grid points in x direction
* `nfft2` Number of grid points in y direction
* `nfft3` Number of grid points in z direction
* `quadrature` : quadrature to be used for angular integration, i.e., for the discretization of the angular grid.
    - `L` for [Lebedev quadrature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebedev_quadrature) (recommanded)
    - `GL` for [Gauss-Legendre quadrature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature)
* `order_of_quadrature` Order of the angular integration. Indirectly define the number of discret angles of the angular grid.
    - `3` is recommanded for water
    - For Gauss-Legendre quadratures, the number of angles is 2*2^order.
    - For Lebedev quadratures, it is 2/3 of the number of angles one would have for Gauss-Legendre quadratures. Works only for 6, 14, 26 and 38.
* `nb_psi` Number of discrete angles for third Euler angle, i.e., for the rotation around the molecular axis.
    - `1` for stockmayer and other linear molecules
    - `4` or more are recommanded for water
    
#####SOLVENT DEFINITION
* `nb_implicit_species` Number of solvent species
    - `1` if the solvent is pure
* `mole_fractions` Mole fraction of each solvent species. Sum of mole fractions of all solvent species is 1.
    - `1.0` if the solvent is pure
* `ck_species` specify which type of correlation functions you want to use to describe the solvent, those file are stored in input/direct_correlation_functions... or you can provide your own files in the input directory and use the tag: 'perso'
* `readDensityDensityCorrelationFunction` If true the density-density pair correlation functions files specified (cs.in) in 'ck_species' will be read, this is necessary if you want to include  dipolar polarization or multipolar polarization without charge-density coupling.
* `polarization` do you want to include any type of polarization: dipolar or multipolar?
* `polarization_order` if dipol will use cdelta and cd to compute the purely dipolar polarization contribution to free energy, if multi will use suceptiblities to compute the multipolar polarozation contribution to free energy.
*`include_nc_coupling` if you want to also compute the density-charge term in polarization set T to this keyword, this only works with multipolar polarization and if it is the case the code will not use the cs.in density-density correlation function even if you set T to 'readDensityDensityCorrelationFunction'
* `ref_bulk_density` is the density of the reference fluid, in molecule/Angstrom^3, you should specify the value on the next line.
* `temperature` Temperature in Kelvin, it is only involved in KbT terms
* `sym_order` Order of symetry of the main axis of the solvent molecule
    - `2` for a water molecule that is of molecular point group C2v
    
#####SOLVER
* `minimizer` The minimizer you want to use, bfgs is the more convincing, this should be you 1st choice
* `maximum_iteration_nbr` is the number of iterations afterwich you will stop the minimization if a minimum has not been found yet. Usually if you have not converged after 50 iterations you can give up, something went wrong.
* `epsg` is one criterium of convergence, if at iteration n (F(n-1)-F(n))/F(n)< this value, the minimizer will consider that a minimum is reach, by default we use 0.0001
* `pgtol`is the other criterium of convergence if the sum of the norm of dF[rho(r,Omega)]/drho(r,Omega) on all space and angular grid points < this value, the minimizer will consider that a minimum is reach, by default we use 0.001

#####IDEAL TERM
* `Linearize_entropy`set T if you want to linearize the ideal term of the functunial, if is is the case you need to specify how you want to do that on the next keyword:`if_Linearize_entropy. Usually you do not want to Linearize the ideal term so put the tag F.
* `if_Linearize_entropy` 1: you will linearize wrt n(r) which the density averaged on the angle, if 2: you will linearize wrt rho(r,omega) which is the space and angular dependent density

#####POTENTIALS
Hereafter you described what kind of potential you want to use to compute the external potential.
* `annihilate_solute_charges` if T all charges of all the sites of the solute are switched off.
* `poisson_solver`if T the electrostatic potential generated by the solute will be computed using a poisson solver, i.e using the charge density of the solute, it is quicker than the folowwing way, so it should be used in most of the case.
* `point_charge_electrostatic`if T the electrostatic potential generated by the solute will be computed using a direct way i.e V=q/(4pi.epsilon0.r) this is slower than the previous way.
WARNING: Note that if you set T to the two previous keywords, you will computed the electrostatic potential due to the solute TWICE, this should never be the case.
* `reuse_density`if T instead of starting the minimization from a guess density, it will use as a starting point the density stored in output/density.bin.out, so if you want to restart a minimization from a previous one you have to move the file output/density.in.out into input/density.bin.in and set T to this keyword. Note that for safety the code after reading this input/density.bin.in will move it into output/density.bin.in.out to avoid you using it accidentaly
#####POST-PROCESSING
* `translate_solute_to_center` If true will add Lx/2 (resp Ly/2, Lz/2) to the x(resp y, z) coordinate of the solute read in solute.in WARNING: as described if your solute is not in 0 0 0 this will not translate it at the center of the box.
* `rdfmaxrange`is the value in angstrom until which you want the radial distribution functions of the solute wrt to te solvent to be computed
* `nbinsrdf`  # the radial distribution function is calculated by histograms. nbinsrdf is the number of bins. usually you should have around 4-5 bins per angstrom

#####HARD SPHERES
* `bridge_hard_sphere` T if you want to use an Hard Sphere bridge correction, described in Levesque et al., The Journal of Chemical Physics 137, 034115 (2012), if it is the case, you need also to compute the total free energy for an hard sphere fluid, i.e, the tag on the next keyword `hard_sphere_fluid` MUST ALSO BE T.
* `hard_sphere_fluid` T if you want to treat your solvent as an hard sphere fluid, if it is the case your should also choose an hard sphere as solvent in solvent.in, except if you want to add a Hard sphere correction to a molecular fluid, or if you want to use an HS bridge.(cf supra)
* `hard_sphere_radius`The radius in Angstrom of the Hard sphere solvent is set in line right after this keyword
* `hs_functional` which type of functional you want to use for the hard sphere fluid, either Carnahan-Starling(CS) or Percus-Yevick (PY)
* `lennard_jones_perturbation_to_hard_spheres`T if you want to add a lennard jones contribution to the hard sphere solvent, this contribution is computed using the WCA theory. If you are not using a HS solvent then the tag MUST BE F. 

#####OTHER STUFF
* `hydrophobicity` if T you will include long range correction designed to get some hydrophobic behaviour for your solvent, the way it is done is specified in the next keyword
* `treatment_of_hydro` the way you want to compute this hydrophobic correction: VdW use a correction which is based on the Hard Sphere Bridge Correction so if you want to use it you MUST set T to hard_sphere_fluid AND set F to bridge_hard_sphere, the theory is described in jeanmairet et al., THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 139, 154101 (2013). C use a correction that CANNOT BE USE with an HS bridge and it is base on Varrilly et al., THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 134, 074109 (2011) 
* `threebody` if T you will include a correction which will enforse the tetrahedrality of the solvent, this necessary to get good rdf for solvation of ions in water, this is based on the Molinero-Stillinger model described in Molinero et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 4008â€“4016. there is currenty two way to add this correction.
*`lambda_solvent` You can add a term which will enforce the solvent-solvent tetrahedrality if you want to you can set the value of this parameter to a non-zero value, but please be carefull because it has not been really tested for the moment.
The parameters of the correction for the solute/solvent interactions are stored in solute.in, please see the solute.in description.
* `Rc` please ignore this parameter this should be fixed as fast as possible by Guillaume et Maximilien
*`verbose` this tag should control the verbosity of the programme it has no effect for the moment

#####HARD SPHERICAL SOLUTE
* `hard_sphere_solute` if T it will add an Hard Sphere in the center of the box. If you want to use a purely hard sphere for solute , you also need to use the solute called "Hard Sphere" in solute.in
*`radius_of_hard_sphere_solute` the value in Angstroms of the hard sphere solute
######HARD WALL
* `HARD WALL` the number of hard wall you want to introduce in the supercell, those walls are described by the n next lines (n beeing the number of hard walls you decided to introduce). There are described by 7 reals, the fist is the thickness of the wall, the next 3 are the coordinates of a vector normal to the surface of the wall, the next 3 are coordinates on Ox Oy Oz axis of a point belonging the median plane of the wall.
######HARD CORE with vdw radius
* `vdw_hard_core` ???
#####HARD CYLINDER
* `hard_cylinder` if T it will include an hard cylinder at the center of the box the axis of the cylinder in on the z direction
* `radius_of_hard_cylinder`here you specify what radius you want for the hard cylinder, in Angstrom
#####PERSONAL VEXT
* `personal_vext` if you want to use a specific form for the external potential that is not possible to use with the descriptors included in this dft.in file, you can set T to this keyword and then edit the file src/personal_vext.f90 where you can compute your specific external potential
* `vext_hard_square_well` T if you want to use a square well potential as external potential
* `hard_well_total_length`specify the length of the square well.  potential is zero from Lz/2-hard_well_total_length/2 to Lz/2+hard_well_total_length/2 and \infty elsewhere
* `purely_repulsive_solute`if T it will add the repulsive part of a LJ to your solute, as described in Dzubiella et al., J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 121, No. 11, 15 September 2004. If you want to include only this repulsive part, you need to use the solute called "Hard Sphere" in solute.in
* `radius_of_purely_repulsive_solute` is the radius of the purely repulsive sphere as descibed in Dzubiella et al., J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 121, No. 11, 15 September 2004.



### solute.in
The program will automatically take the first solute in solute.in to be the solute you use in your computation. The first line must be the name of the solute.
1st line:name of the solute
2nd line:Should be integer free-space integer: the 1st integer is the total number of solute site (e.g 3 in SPC/E water); the 2nd integer is the number of differents site type in the solute, two site have the same type if they have the same charge, the same Lennard-Jones parameter (sigma, epsilon), (e.g in SPC/E water there are 2 atoms type, the O atom and the H atoms).
3rd line: it is a comment line to help you remember the differents parameters which describe your solute sites in the following lines.
4th line and the following:are used to describe the solute sites you Must have as many of those lines as there are solute sites, i.e the total of thos lines should be equal to the 1st integer of the 2nd line.
Here is the description of the differents parameters you must give to describe a solute site in the order they should appear from left to right:
* `#` is the index of the site type, all of the sites of the same type must have the same integer to begin the line, thoses indexes should go from 1 to the second integer of the 2nd line
* `charge` is a real, it is the charge of your solute site in elementary charge unit (e.g. 1.0 for sodium cation, -1.0 for chlorine anion)
* `sigma`is a real, it is the value, in angstrom of the sigma parameter in the LJ potential describing the interaction of the site with a identical site according to the following expression of the LJ potential: V=4\epsilon((\sigma/r)^12-(\sigma/r)^6)
* `epsilon`is a real, it is the value, in kJ/mol of the epsilon parameter in the LJ potential describing the interaction of the site with a identical site according to the following expression of the LJ potential: V=4\epsilon((\sigma/r)^12-(\sigma/r)^6)
* `lambda1_mol` is a real without dimension it is a parameter describing the strength of the tetrahedrality added by the three body correction for H-bond interactions from the solute site to the water molecules in first shell
* `lambda2_mol` is a real without dimension it is a parameter describing the strength of the tetrahedrality added by the three body correction for H-bond interactions  water molecules in first shell to water molecule in the second shell. See Zhao et al., J. Chem. Phys. 134, 194102 (2011).
* `x` real. The coordinate on the X axis of the solute site, in Angstrom, please note that the center of the box is in (Lx/2,Ly/2, Lz/2). See also translate_solute_to_center in dft.in. 
* `y` real. The coordinate on the Y axis of the solute site, in Angstrom, please note that the center of the box is in (Lx/2,Ly/2, Lz/2). See also translate_solute_to_center in dft.in. 
* `z` real. The coordinate on the Z axis of the solute site, in Angstrom, please note that the center of the box is in (Lx/2,Ly/2, Lz/2). See also translate_solute_to_center in dft.in. 
* `Zatomic` integer, is the Atomic Number of the Atom of the site. This is not used in the computation, so you could set whatever you want for a site as long as it is an integer.
* `Atom Name` String it is the name of the atom of the site,This is not used in the computation, so you could set whatever you want for a site as long as it is a string
* `Surname` Surname of the site, this can be usefull if you have different type of the same atom to remember what kind it is, (e.g for the description of the type of H in a protein described by Amber forcefield) This is not used in the computation, so you could set whatever you want for a site as long as it is a string.

### solvent.in

The structure is exactly the same than solute.in except that there is less parameter to use to describe the solvent, please see the description of paramaters in the description of solute.in above
